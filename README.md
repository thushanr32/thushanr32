I am a 3rd year computer science and statistics student at the University of Maryland.

I'm broadly interested in software engineering, machine learning, and stat/math.

Previously, I've worked at [Collins Aerospace](https://www.collinsaerospace.com/) as a Software Engineer Intern, at the [UMD CS Department](https://www.cs.umd.edu/) as a Student Research Assistant, at [Radian](https://www.radian.com/) as a Dev Ops Intern, and at the [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov/) as a Software Engineer Intern.

âš¡ Fun fact: I enjoy cooking various cuisines including Mexican, Greek, Italian, Sri Lankan, and more. I also enjoy hitting the gym and I'm learning how to shoot/edit videos and take aesthetic photos.
